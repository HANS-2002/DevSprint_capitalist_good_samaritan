## Problem Statement
I see a peculiar problem among the students of KIIT that many students miss on a life changing oppurtunities such as internships, placement news and registrations for various socities in KIIT, just because they didn't get the news at the right time (I am one of them too). Hence my idea is to implement an MVP of a social platform for KIIT students wherein they get every news related to every possible oppurtunity available to them. I am planning to do it on the MERN stack. My team will try our best to deliver it within the time frame.
